Write a query that'll identify returning active users. A returning active user is a user that has made a second purchase within 7 days of any other of their purchases. 

Output a list of user_ids of these returning active users.

id:  int
user_id:  int
item:  varchar
created_at:  datetime
revenue:  int


SELECT DISTINCT user_id
FROM amazon_transaction a1
JOIN amazon_transaction a2
ON a1.user_id = a2.user_id
AND a1.id <> a2.id
AND DATEDIFF(day, a1.created_at, a2.created_at) BETWEEN 0 AND 7
ORDER BY user_id





Alternate-



SELECT DISTINCT user_id
FROM (select user_id, 
        created_at,
        lead ( created_at ) over ( partition by user_id order by created_at) as l 
        from amazon_transactions) AS t
WHERE DATEDIFF(day, created_at, 1) < = 7
