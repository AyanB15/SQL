-- A database contains daily covid cases reported for 2021.
    1. Calculate the percentage increase in covid cases each month
    2. Cumulative cases as of the prior month.
Return the month number and the percentage increase rounded to 1 decimal. Order result by month.

Table: Daily_cases - record_date, case_count

METHOD 1 - 

-- Bringing the data to month level from day level.

            WITH CTE AS ( SELECT MONTH(record_date) AS month_number, SUM(case_count) AS monthly_cases
                          FROM Daily_cases
                          GROUP BY MONTH(record_date)
                        ) ,
Now, calculate the cumulative number of cases as of prior month.

           CTE2 AS  ( SELECT cc.month_number AS current_month, pm.month_number AS previous_month, cm.monthly_cases AS current_count, pm.monthly_cases AS prior_count              
                      FROM CTE cm LEFT JOIN pm
                      ON pm.month_number < cm.month_number
                    )


SELECT current_month, current_count, SUM(prior_count) AS cum_sum, ROUND(current_count * 100.0/ SUM(prior_count),1)
FROM CTE2
GROUP BY current_month, current_count



METHOD 2 - 

            WITH CTE AS ( SELECT MONTH(record_date) AS month_number,
                          SUM(case_count) AS monthly_cases
                          FROM Daily_cases
                          GROUP BY MONTH(record_date)
                        ),


            CTE2 AS ( SELECT *,
                      SUM(monthly_cases) OVER (ORDER BY month_number ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEEDING AND 1 PRECEEDING) AS cum_sum
                      FROM CTE
                    )

            SELECT month_number, monthly_cases, ROUND(monthly_cases * 100.0 / cum_sum,1)
            FROM CTE2
