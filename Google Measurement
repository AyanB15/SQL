Challenge: Google SQL Interview Question | Difficulty Level : Medium

Assume you're given a table with measurement values obtained from a Google sensor over multiple days with measurements taken multiple times within each day.
Write a query to calculate the sum of odd-numbered and even-numbered measurements separately for a particular day and display the results in two different columns.

measurements Table

---------------------------------
| Column Name    | Type    |
---------------------------------
| measurement_id  | integer  |
| measurement_value | decimal  |
| measurement_time | datetime  |
---------------------------------


My Solution :
WITH cte AS
(SELECT *,RANK() 
 OVER(PARTITION BY DATE(measurement_time) ORDER BY measurement_time) AS index_ FROM measurements)

SELECT DATE(measurement_time) AS measurement_day , 
SUM(CASE WHEN index_ % 2 != 0 THEN measurement_value ELSE 0 END) AS odd_sum, 
SUM(CASE WHEN index_ % 2 = 0 THEN measurement_value ELSE 0 END) AS even_sum FROM cte
GROUP BY DATE(measurement_time)
ORDER BY 1 ASC;
